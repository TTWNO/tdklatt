Usage
=====
Right now, all of the classes and functions of tdklatt are available as a single module (`tdklatt.py`). In the future, it will likely be distributed in a package format instead.

To use tdklatt, all you need to do is clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/guestdaniel/tdklatt 
```

Alternatively (if you don't use git) you can download the repository in RAR format using the button in the upper right of the repoistory page and unzip it somewhere.

Once you have the repository on your computer, launch a Python 3 session in that folder and do the following:

```python
import tdklatt
```
